# Car Sales Analysis
This repo is for a Car Sales Analysis project

In the notebook `Linear Regression for car sales.ipynb`, I started with data preprocessing (relaxed assumptions, log transformation, and obtained dummies). I then used the clean data set to train a Linear Regression model using sklearn & statsmodel.
